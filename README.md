# MockInstagramWebsite

An Instagram clone implemented with client-side dynamic pages, with many of the same features, including the ability to create/delete accounts, post photos, like/unlike/comment posts, follow/unfollow people from the explore page, and change portfolio photos or login passwords which are stored using SHA512.

The client application is written in JavaScript/React which runs in the browser and makes AJAX calls to the REST API. The REST API is written in Python/Flask, with user data stored in the database using MySQL.
